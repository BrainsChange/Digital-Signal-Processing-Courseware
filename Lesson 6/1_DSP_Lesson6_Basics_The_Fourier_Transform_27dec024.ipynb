    "Quick terminology note: You may run across the term \"Fast Fourier Transform\" (FFT). It happens that, if one makes certain assumptions or adopts certain restrictions about one's data, one can derive some computational shortcuts to accomplish the DFT faster. Generally, FFT refers to suc a method for doing a DFT. A common restriction is that the length of the timeseries is a power of 2. That's one reason one sometimes sees a sampling rate of 512 or 1024; or, for say 1000 Hz sampling rate, an analysis epoch of 1.024 seconds (containing 1024 samples). Everything we've discussed here applies to those cases, but we've considered the general case - not limited e.g. to power-of-2 analysis epochs."
