But the spectrum that the Discrete Fourier Transform will use to represent that information may not consist of the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases in the digitized timeseries. If you're asking Fourier to build a model to represent data with fidelity, it'll deliver for you. If you're asking Fourier to tell you wnat frequencies, amplitudes, and phases are in your timeseries...consider the issues that Lesson 6 has discussed.)"
