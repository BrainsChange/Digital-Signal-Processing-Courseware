    "Here is a 1 Hz sine wave. Although in general a sine wave is a continuous function, it is helpful to think of the sine wave as a sequence of discrete values (such as a vector of values that results from our sampling a continuous function). Such a sequence is called a timeseries. Normally sine waves are characterized in terms of frequency, which is the number of complete cycles per second. In the plot above, we've created a sine wave that completes exactly 1 cycle in 1 second. An important analogy that we will develop and use later is that we can think of the above sine wave as traveling exactly once around a 2\\$\\pi$ circle. As such, a single sine-wave cycle has a length of 2$\\pi$. Given the fact that there are 2$\\pi$ units around a circle, the first period occurs at 2$\\pi$. In terms of time, the frequency and the period are reciprocals of each other.\n",

    "Here we treat the amplitude as the vertical distance from 0 on the y axis to the highest or lowest y-axis value. Thus, in the plot above, 6 is the peak amplitude of the 5 Hz sine wave. In some contexts, amplitude is measured as the peak-to-peak amplitude. In the plot above, the peak-to-peak amplitude is 12. In this book, we'll define amplitude as the absolute value of the distance from 0 to the highest or lowest y-axis value. There are other ways to quantify the amplitude, some of which we'll discuss, but always keep in mind the basic notion of amplitude as 0 to peak."

People in the know refer to increasing or decreasing the amplitude of a signal as changing the signal's gain. In common use, the term gain indicates an increase in magnitude, but more generally it refers to any ratio of output to input, and gain may be greater than, equal to, or less than 1.0.

    "To convert radians to degrees, we make use of the fact that $\\pi$ radians equals one half of a circle, or 180¬∞. If we divide radians by $\\pi$, the answer is the number of half circles. Multiplying this by 180¬∞ will provide the answer in degrees. Therefore, degrees = radians * (180¬∞)/$\\pi$ . That works because the units on the 180 is degrees, and the units on the $\\pi$ is radians. So, in units, that conversion is (radians * degrees / radians) = degrees. It would work the same if, instead of (180¬∞)/$\\pi$ , we used (360¬∞)/(2$\\pi$]), because in both cases the numerator is the same proportion of a circle or cycle as the denominator."
