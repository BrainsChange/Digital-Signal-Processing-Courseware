In later lessons, as we examine more advanced topics, we will need to have a good understanding of several identities relating sine/cosine functions and complex exponentials. (We don't really need complex exponentials themselves for work on signal processing, but the tools already developed to work with them are valuable for working with sine/cosine functions. These tools include concepts, algorithms, and software already developed. Might as well save ourselves some work later with a little investment up front.) The similarity between sine/cosine functions and complex exponentials will be examined over the next few lessons. Eventually, once we're familiar with these identities, we'll see that, instead of using sines and cosines, we'll often prefer using complex exponentials."

For example, the largest positive value occurs at the 192nd point. If each point equals 4 ms, that is $192 \\times 4$ ms = 768 ms. However, before you interpret that, you may want to remove the 500 ms baseline that preceded the stimulus onset, as well as an additional 4 ms for the zero point. (To explain the latter issue: the first data point occurs at 0 ms, and the 2nd point occurs 4 ms into the vector, not $2\\times4=8$ ms into the vector.) Thus, the latency of the maximum peak is 768 - 500 - 4 = 264 ms after the onset of the stimulus. Follow the same procedure to find that the latency of the largest negative peak is: $171 \\times 4$ ms = 684 ms; 684 - 500 - 4 = 180 ms. "
