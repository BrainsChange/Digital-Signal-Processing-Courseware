    "Congrats - you finished the Lesson 1 Basic and Tutorial notebooks, and you're starting the Lesson 1 Give it a Try notebooks. That means we're going to do less hand-holding. Besides checking what you know from the Basics and Tutorial, will ask you to extend what you know to things we haven't covered already. This can sometimes mean providing a quick answer to a question, or sometimes copying a line of code from a previous cell and doing a small edit, such as changing the value of the 'freq' frequency variable, or adding a gain multiplier, or adding an extra label to a plot. Our interest isn't in whether you \"pass the quiz\" but in getting you to think about how to apply extent something you learned in the Basics and Tutorial notebooks."

    "First, a new term: \"stationary\". A sine wave is said to be stationary when its frequency, amplitude, and phase don't change, beyond the inherent oscillation in its amplitude and phase. Imagine for a moment what a sine wave would look like if we suddenly changed its amplitude, or its phase. Across the epoch of data, it would no longer be just a simple, continuous sine wave. For now, just note that what we've been talking about are \"stationary timeseries\". Of course, most real-world signals change over time, beyond just sinusoidal oscillations. There are interesting implications of that, which we'll get to in a later lesson."
