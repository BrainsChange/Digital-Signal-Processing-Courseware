    "A so-called analog signal can take any value in a range, and it changes smoothly (continuously) between values. Thus, an analog signal is any signal continuous in both time and amplitude. Analog signals are often thought of in an electrical context. For example, in an analog sound recording, the variation in air pressure of a sound striking a microphone could create a corresponding variation in the electrical current passing through a circuit in the microphone, and that current is sent on to an amplifier and a recording device, such as a traditional tape recorder. That variation happens on a continuous basis. The recorded signal is continuous and is an \"analog\" of the original, real-world phenomenon.\n",

And we can store a series of such samples in a vector, in our computer's memory (in RAM, on disk, whatever), then do turn our digital computer loose to crunch the data. For that to happen, we use a circuit called an analog-to-digital converter (A/D converter, sometimes just ADC). There's an A/D converter in an MRI scanner, digitizing what the receiver coil picks up. If you plug a ribbon cable from an EEG cap into a box that sends the EEG on to your lab computer, typically these days that box contains an A/D converter that samples each channel and sends a series of values to your computer via a USB connection. In older equipment, the A/D converter will be on a card inserted into the computer. One way or another, we convert analog (continuous) to digital (discrete) signals so that our digital computer can handle the data."

Lesson 2 is interested in the rate of that sampling - how often the A/D conversion happens for a given signal.\n",

In the examples provided in this digital signal processing e-book, the external phenomena that we represent via our time (or distance/space) series are considered to be analog events - they are continuous across time and/or space. Thus, a bird's song (analog) is continuous (physical disturbances in air). Our digitized recording of the bird's song, however, contains discrete values and is ... digital.
